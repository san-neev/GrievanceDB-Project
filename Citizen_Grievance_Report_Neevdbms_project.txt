ABSTRACT

The Citizen Grievance Redressal Database is an Open Source Database
Management System (OSDBMS) project designed to provide a structured and
efficient solution for managing citizen complaints related to government
and municipal services. In many public administration systems,
grievances are often recorded manually or maintained in unstructured
spreadsheets, which leads to data redundancy, inconsistency, and delays
in resolution. This project focuses on transforming such unorganised
grievance records into a well-structured relational database using
MySQL.

The system is developed by applying database normalisation techniques to
convert unnormalised data into properly related tables such as Citizens,
Departments, Grievances, Officers, and StatusHistory. By using primary
keys, foreign keys, and integrity constraints, the database ensures
accuracy, transparency, and efficient data retrieval. SQL operations
including INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOIN queries, and GROUP BY reports are
implemented to demonstrate real-world database functionality.

The main goal of this project is to provide practical exposure to DBMS
concepts while showcasing how structured database design improves
performance, reduces redundancy, and maintains data integrity in an
e-Governance environment. The project operates as a backend database
system without a frontend interface and is intended for academic
learning purposes.

1. INTRODUCTION

A Citizen Grievance Redressal System (CGRS) is a fundamental component
of e-Governance, providing citizens with a structured and formal channel
to lodge complaints against government and municipal services.
Government bodies are responsible for offering a reliable mechanism for
citizens to report grievances related to Public Services (such as Public
Education, Public Safety, and Public Health) and Civic Services (such as
Water Supply, Electricity, Road Maintenance, Sanitation, Public
Transportation, Healthcare, and Municipal Administration).

As urbanisation increases and population continues to grow, the volume
of grievances filed by citizens rises substantially. Manually processing
these grievances, or using unorganised systems such as registers and
spreadsheets, leads to data loss, duplication of records, inconsistent
status updates, and delayed resolutions. A properly designed Database
Management System (DBMS) is therefore essential to store, manage, and
retrieve grievance-related data in an efficient and reliable manner.

This project has been designed and implemented using MySQL to develop a
structured, normalised Citizen Grievance Redressal Database. The
disorganised grievance data has been transformed into a relational
database by applying normalisation rules — Unnormalized Form, First
Normal Form (1NF), and a fully normalised relational structure — to
eliminate data redundancy, preserve data integrity, prevent anomalies,
and improve overall database performance.

MySQL is selected as the database platform because it is open-source,
reliable, widely used in academic and government applications, and
supports SQL queries, constraints, transaction control, indexing, and
security mechanisms. This project provides practical exposure to DBMS
concepts and demonstrates how proper database design improves storage
efficiency, data accuracy, and query performance in real-world
e-Governance applications.

2. PROBLEM DEFINITION

Many government bodies and municipal corporations continue to maintain
citizen grievance records using manual registers or unstructured
spreadsheets. These traditional approaches result in several critical
problems that reduce the efficiency and transparency of the grievance
redressal process:

-   Data Redundancy – Citizen names, contact details, and department
    information are repeatedly stored in multiple records, consuming
    unnecessary storage space.

-   Data Inconsistency – When grievance status is updated in one record
    but not in others, the data becomes inconsistent and unreliable.

-   Update Anomaly – Changing a department name or officer assignment
    requires updates across multiple rows, increasing the risk of
    errors.

-   Insertion Anomaly – A new grievance cannot be registered without
    having complete citizen and department information available
    simultaneously.

-   Deletion Anomaly – Deleting a grievance record may unintentionally
    remove important citizen or department information from the system.

-   Multi-Valued Attributes – Storing multiple grievances for a single
    citizen in one field (comma-separated) prevents proper querying and
    analysis.

-   Slow Query Performance – Large, unstructured tables make it
    difficult to generate status-wise or department-wise reports
    efficiently.

-   Lack of Audit Trail – Without proper status history tracking, it is
    impossible to know when a grievance was last updated and by whom.

These issues highlight the urgent need for a structured, normalised
relational database that properly organises citizen, grievance,
department, officer, and status data into separate related tables —
ensuring consistency, transparency, and efficiency in grievance
redressal.

3. OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

The main objectives of this project are:

-   To design and implement a structured Citizen Grievance Redressal
    Database using MySQL.

-   To apply database normalisation rules (Unnormalized Form to 1NF to a
    fully normalised relational structure) to organise grievance data
    properly.

-   To eliminate data redundancy and prevent update, insertion, and
    deletion anomalies.

-   To create multiple related tables (Citizens, Departments,
    Grievances, Officers, StatusHistory) connected using primary keys
    and foreign keys.

-   To implement SQL queries for data manipulation including INSERT,
    UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT operations.

-   To generate department-wise and status-wise grievance reports using
    GROUP BY and JOIN operations.

-   To enforce data integrity through constraints such as PRIMARY KEY,
    FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and DEFAULT.

-   To implement role-based database security using GRANT and REVOKE
    commands.

-   To set up backup and recovery mechanisms using mysqldump to prevent
    data loss.

-   To gain practical experience with Database Management System (DBMS)
    concepts applied in a real-world e-Governance scenario.

4. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

The scope of the Citizen Grievance Redressal Database project includes
the following areas:

-   Conversion of unnormalised data into structured tables – The project
    transforms a single flat grievance table containing repeated and
    multi-valued data into multiple related, normalised tables.

-   Application of normalisation rules – The data passes through
    Unnormalised Form (UNF), First Normal Form (1NF), and a fully
    normalised relational structure to ensure data integrity and
    eliminate redundancy.

-   Creation of entities and relationships – Tables such as Citizens,
    Departments, Grievances, Officers, and StatusHistory are created and
    connected using primary and foreign keys to model real-world
    grievance workflows.

-   Implementation of SQL operations – SQL commands including CREATE,
    INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT are used to define and manage the
    database. Advanced operations like JOIN queries and GROUP BY reports
    are also implemented.

-   Use of constraints – PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and
    DEFAULT constraints are applied to maintain data accuracy and
    referential integrity.

-   Database security – Role-based access control is implemented using
    GRANT and REVOKE commands to restrict unauthorized access.

-   Backup and recovery – Regular backups using mysqldump and
    table-level backup strategies are implemented to safeguard data.

This project is limited to backend database design using MySQL and is
intended primarily for academic learning. It does not include a frontend
user interface. The database is designed to handle small to medium
datasets (100 to 1,000 records) and is structured to be scalable for
future enhancements.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

6. SYSTEM DESIGN

6.1 System Architecture

The Citizen Grievance Redressal Database follows a simple
database-centred architecture. The user interacts directly with the
database using SQL queries executed through MySQL Workbench. There is no
frontend interface; the entire system operates at the backend level.

The core component of the system is MySQL Server, which is responsible
for storing, managing, and processing all citizen, grievance,
department, officer, and status history data. The server ensures that
data is stored in normalised tables and maintains relationships using
primary keys and foreign keys.

When a user executes an SQL command such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or
SELECT, the query is sent to the MySQL Server. The server validates the
query syntax, checks constraints, verifies relationships between tables,
and processes the request. If the query violates any constraint (for
example, a duplicate primary key or an invalid foreign key reference),
the server rejects the operation to maintain data integrity.

The architecture ensures:

-   Proper organisation of grievance data into multiple related tables

-   Elimination of redundancy through normalisation

-   Enforcement of data integrity using constraints

-   Secure access control through user privileges

-   Reliable transaction execution using COMMIT and ROLLBACK

6.2 Data Flow

The data flow in the system is straightforward. The citizen's grievance
information flows through the following stages:

1.  Citizen data is entered into the Citizens table with a unique
    citizen_id.

2.  Department and Officer data are pre-populated in the Departments and
    Officers tables.

3.  A grievance is submitted by linking citizen_id and dept_id in the
    Grievances table with a description, category, and submit_date.

4.  Officers update the status of grievances, and each update is
    recorded in the StatusHistory table with remarks and update_date.

5.  Administrators can query the database to generate department-wise
    and status-wise reports using JOIN and GROUP BY operations.

6.3 System Architecture Flow

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Step      Component               Role
  --------- ----------------------- --------------------------------------
  1         User                    Enters SQL query in MySQL Workbench

  2         MySQL Workbench         Sends query to MySQL Server

  3         MySQL Server            Validates syntax and checks
                                    constraints

  4         GrievanceDB             Executes query on the database tables

  5         MySQL Server            Returns result to Workbench

  6         User                    Views result in tabular form
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. DATABASE DESIGN

Each entity represents a separate real-world object involved in the
citizen grievance redressal process. The database is divided into
multiple related tables to maintain a normalised structure and eliminate
data redundancy.

7.1 Entity Description

-   Citizens – Stores details of citizens who file grievances. Each
    citizen is uniquely identified by citizen_id and contains their
    name, contact number, and address.

-   Departments – Contains information about government departments
    responsible for resolving specific types of grievances. Each
    department is identified by dept_id and includes dept_name and
    location.

-   Grievances – The core table that records each complaint filed by a
    citizen against a specific department. It stores grievance_id,
    references to citizen_id and dept_id, a description, category,
    submit_date, and current status.

-   Officers – Stores information about government officers assigned to
    handle grievances within specific departments. Each officer is
    linked to a department via dept_id.

-   StatusHistory – An audit table that tracks every status update made
    to a grievance. It records the officer who made the update, the new
    status, date of update, and remarks.

7.3 Constraints Used

In this project, various constraints are applied in MySQL to maintain
accuracy, consistency, and proper relationships between tables.

-   PRIMARY KEY – Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
    citizen_id, dept_id, grievance_id, officer_id, and history_id serve
    as primary keys, ensuring no duplicate records exist in any table.

-   FOREIGN KEY – Establishes relationships between tables. For example,
    citizen_id and dept_id in the Grievances table reference the
    Citizens and Departments tables respectively, ensuring referential
    integrity and preventing orphan records.

-   NOT NULL – Ensures that important fields such as citizen_name,
    description, category, submit_date, and remarks cannot be left
    empty, guaranteeing essential information is always stored.

-   UNIQUE – Prevents duplicate values in the contact field of the
    Citizens table, ensuring no two citizens share the same mobile
    number.

-   DEFAULT – The status field in the Grievances table is assigned a
    default value of 'Pending' when a new grievance is filed, reducing
    the need for manual status entry.

-   AUTO_INCREMENT – Applied to grievance_id, officer_id, and history_id
    to automatically generate sequential unique identifiers without
    manual input.

9. SQL IMPLEMENTATION

The SQL implementation of the Citizen Grievance Redressal Database was
performed using MySQL. The implementation demonstrates how unnormalised
grievance data is converted into a proper normalised relational database
structure by applying normalisation rules.

9.1 Database Creation

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CREATE DATABASE GrievanceDB;
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  USE GrievanceDB;

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

9.2 Unnormalised Table

Initially all grievance-related information was stored in a single table
containing repeated and multi-valued data. This structure causes data
redundancy, update anomalies, and multi-valued attributes stored in one
column.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CREATE TABLE grievance_unnormalized (
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  citizen_id INT,

  citizen_name VARCHAR(100),

  contact VARCHAR(15),

  department_name VARCHAR(100),

  officer_name VARCHAR(100),

  grievances VARCHAR(500)

  );

  INSERT INTO grievance_unnormalized VALUES

  (1,'Ramesh','9876543210','Water Dept','Sharma','No water supply, Pipe
  burst'),

  (1,'Ramesh','9876543210','Road Dept','Verma','Pothole on main road'),

  (2,'Sunil','9123456780','Water Dept','Sharma','Dirty water issue');
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

9.3 Conversion to First Normal Form (1NF)

To achieve 1NF, repeating groups and multi-valued attributes were
removed. Each grievance is now stored as a separate atomic row:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CREATE TABLE grievance_1nf (
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  citizen_id INT,

  citizen_name VARCHAR(100),

  department_name VARCHAR(100),

  officer_name VARCHAR(100),

  grievance VARCHAR(300)

  );

  INSERT INTO grievance_1nf VALUES

  (1,'Ramesh','Water Dept','Sharma','No water supply'),

  (1,'Ramesh','Water Dept','Sharma','Pipe burst'),

  (1,'Ramesh','Road Dept','Verma','Pothole on main road'),

  (2,'Sunil','Water Dept','Sharma','Dirty water issue');
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

9.4 Final Normalised Structure

Partial and transitive dependencies are removed by creating separate
related tables connected through foreign keys:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CREATE TABLE citizens (
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  citizen_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,

  citizen_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,

  contact VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL UNIQUE,

  address VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL

  );

  CREATE TABLE departments (

  dept_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,

  dept_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,

  location VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL

  );

  CREATE TABLE officers (

  officer_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,

  officer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,

  dept_id INT,

  FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(dept_id)

  );

  CREATE TABLE grievances (

  grievance_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,

  citizen_id INT,

  dept_id INT,

  description VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,

  category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

  submit_date DATE NOT NULL,

  status VARCHAR(30) DEFAULT 'Pending',

  FOREIGN KEY (citizen_id) REFERENCES citizens(citizen_id),

  FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(dept_id)

  );

  CREATE TABLE statushistory (

  history_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,

  grievance_id INT,

  officer_id INT,

  status VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,

  update_date DATE NOT NULL,

  remarks VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (grievance_id) REFERENCES grievances(grievance_id),

  FOREIGN KEY (officer_id) REFERENCES officers(officer_id)

  );
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

9.5 Data Retrieval Using JOIN

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- View all grievances with citizen name, department and status
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  SELECT c.citizen_name, d.dept_name, g.description,

  g.category, g.submit_date, g.status

  FROM grievances g

  JOIN citizens c ON g.citizen_id = c.citizen_id

  JOIN departments d ON g.dept_id = d.dept_id;

  -- Department-wise grievance count report

  SELECT d.dept_name, COUNT(g.grievance_id) AS total_grievances

  FROM grievances g

  JOIN departments d ON g.dept_id = d.dept_id

  GROUP BY d.dept_name;

  -- Status-wise grievance count

  SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS total FROM grievances GROUP BY status;
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

9.6 Transaction Management

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  START TRANSACTION;
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  INSERT INTO citizens VALUES (5,'Priya','9000111222','Thane');

  INSERT INTO
  grievances(citizen_id,dept_id,description,category,submit_date)

  VALUES (5,2,'Road broken near school','Road','2026-02-01');

  COMMIT;

  -- Rollback on error

  START TRANSACTION;

  UPDATE grievances SET status='Resolved' WHERE grievance_id=10;

  ROLLBACK;
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Transaction control ensures data consistency when multiple related
operations must all succeed or all fail together.

  | dept_name | total_grievances |

  +------------------------+------------------+

  | Water Department | 2 |

  | Road Department | 1 |

  | Electricity Department | 1 |

  +------------------------+------------------+

  3 rows in set (0.005 sec)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

10.10 Final Result

After applying normalisation and implementing the complete database
structure, the following results were observed:

-   Data redundancy removed – Citizen and department data is stored once
    and referenced via foreign keys.

-   Update anomaly eliminated – Changing a department name only requires
    one update in the Departments table.

-   Referential integrity maintained – Foreign key constraints prevent
    invalid citizen or department references.

-   Audit trail established – StatusHistory records every grievance
    update with officer details and remarks.

-   Structured relational database achieved – All five normalised tables
    exist and function correctly.

11. SECURITY, BACKUP AND RECOVERY

11.1 Database Security

Database security ensures that only authorised users can access and
modify grievance data. Access control is implemented using MySQL's
built-in user management and privilege system.

User Authentication

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CREATE USER 'grievance_admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Admin@2026';
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CREATE USER 'grievance_viewer'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'View@2026';

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Granting Privileges

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON GrievanceDB.* TO 'grievance_admin'@'localhost';
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  GRANT SELECT ON GrievanceDB.* TO 'grievance_viewer'@'localhost';

  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Revoking Privileges

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON GrievanceDB.* FROM
  'grievance_viewer'@'localhost';
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

This ensures only authorised users can modify grievance tables, viewer
users can only read data, and data integrity is maintained through
controlled access.

11.2 Backup Strategy

Full Database Backup

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  mysqldump -u root -p GrievanceDB > grievance_backup.sql
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Table-Level Backup

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CREATE TABLE citizens_backup AS SELECT * FROM citizens;
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CREATE TABLE grievances_backup AS SELECT * FROM grievances;

  CREATE TABLE statushistory_backup AS SELECT * FROM statushistory;
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

11.3 Recovery Process

Restore Full Database

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  mysql -u root -p GrievanceDB < grievance_backup.sql
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Restore From Backup Table

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  INSERT INTO citizens SELECT * FROM citizens_backup
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  WHERE citizen_id NOT IN (SELECT citizen_id FROM citizens);

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

11.4 Transaction Control for Recovery

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  START TRANSACTION;
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  DELETE FROM grievances WHERE status = 'Resolved';

  ROLLBACK; -- Restores all deleted records if error occurs

  COMMIT; -- Confirms the operation if everything is correct
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

After implementing security, backup, and recovery: database access is
restricted to authorised users, all data changes are transactional and
recoverable, backup copies are maintained, and the normalised structure
remains consistent and secure.

12. FUTURE SCOPE AND CONCLUSION

12.1 Future Scope

-   Development of a web or mobile application frontend to allow
    citizens to submit and track grievances online without needing
    direct database access.

-   Implementation of an SMS and Email notification system to
    automatically alert citizens when their grievance status is updated.

-   Integration of stored procedures and triggers to automate routine
    operations such as auto-assigning officers and sending alerts on
    overdue grievances.

-   Development of analytical dashboards for government authorities to
    monitor department performance, average resolution time, and
    grievance trends.

-   Extension to higher normal forms such as BCNF and 4NF for even
    stricter data integrity.

-   Cloud deployment on platforms such as AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL
    for scalability and remote access.

12.2 Conclusion

The Citizen Grievance Redressal Database project successfully
demonstrates the practical implementation of Database Management System
(DBMS) concepts and normalisation techniques in a real-world
e-Governance scenario. By transforming unnormalised grievance data into
a structured, relational database using MySQL, the project has achieved
its core objectives of eliminating redundancy, maintaining data
integrity, and improving query performance.

The five-table normalised structure — Citizens, Departments, Grievances,
Officers, and StatusHistory — efficiently models the entire grievance
lifecycle from submission to resolution. The use of primary keys,
foreign keys, constraints, JOIN queries, and GROUP BY reports
demonstrates how a well-designed database can improve transparency and
accountability in public grievance management systems.

This project strengthens the understanding of structured database design
and its critical importance in building reliable, scalable, and secure
e-Governance applications.
